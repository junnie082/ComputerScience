## Standard I/O Library

#### 2023.10.28.(í† )

### Streams and FILE objects

- stream

  - stream of bytes
  - logical structure used to access physical file
  - when we open or create file with the standard I/O library, we say that we have associated a stream with the file

- FILE object

  - when we open a stream, fopen returns a pointer to a FILE object
  - contains all the information required by the standard I/O library to manage the stream
    - file descriptor
    - pointer to a buffer for the stream
    - size of the buffer
    - counter of the number of characters in the buffer
    - error flag

- predefined stream
  - stdin, stdout, stderr(<stdio.h>)

### Buffering

- goal

  - use the minimum number of read and write system calls

- three types of buffering

  - fully buffered
    - actual I/O takes palce when the standard I/O buffer is filled
    - files that reside on disk are normally fully buffered

- line buffered

  - performs I/O when a newline character('\n') is encountered on input or output
  - used on a stream when it refers to a terminal (standard input and standard output)
  - actual I/O might take place if we fill the buffer befor writing a newline
  - whenever input is requested through the standard I/O library from unbuffered stream of from a line-buffered stream, all line-buffered output streams are flushed

- unbuffered
  - does not buffer the characters
  - ex) standard error stream

### stream buffering operations

- synopsis

  - #include <stdio.h>
  - int setbuf(FILE *stream, char *buf);
  - int setbuffer(FILD *stream, char *buf, size_t size);
  - int setlinebuf(FILE \*stream);
  - int setvbuf(FILE *stream, char *buf, int mode, size_t size);
  - int fflush(FILE \*stream);

- description

  - int setvbuf(FILD *stream, char *buf, int mode, size_t size);
    - may be used at any time on any open stream to change its buffer
    - mode parameter
      - \_IONBF: unbuffered
      - \_IOLBF: line buffered
      - \_IOFBF: fully buffered
    - buf parameter
      - should point to a buffer at least size bytes long (except for unbuffered files)
      - but will be used instead of the current buffer
      - if NULL, only the mode is affected
    - a new buffer will be allocated on the next read or write operation
    - can only change the mode of a stream when it is not "active"
      - before any I/O
      - immediately after a call to fflush()

- int setbuf(FILE *stream, char *buf);

  - setvbuf(stream, buf, buf ? \_IOFBF: \_IONBF, BUFSIZ);
  - BUFSIZ
    - default buffer size(8192 bytes)

- int setbuffer(FILE *stream, char *buf, size_t size);

  - the same as setbuf(), except that the size of the buffer is up to the caller

- int setlinebuf(FILE \*stream);

  - setvbuf(stream, (char \*)NULL, \_IOLBF, 0);

- fflush()
  - forces a write of all buffered data for the given output or update stream via the stream's underlying write function
  - If the stream argument is NULL, fflush flushes all open output streams
  - return value
    - Upon successful completion 0 is returned
    - Otherwise, EOF is returned

### opening a stream

- synopsis

  - #include <stdio.h>
  - FILE *fopen(const char *path, const char \*mode);
  - FILE *fdopen(int fildes, const char *mode);
  - FILE *freopen(const char *path, const char *mode, FILE *stream);

- description
  - FILE *fopen(const char *path, const char \*mode);
    - opens the file whose name is the string pointed to by path and assicates a stream with it
    - mode
      - r: open file for reading
      - r+: open for reading and writing
      - w: truncate file to zero length or create file for writing
      - w+: open for reading and writing, the file is created if it does not exist, otherwise it is truncated
      - a: open for writing. The file is created if it does not exist. The stream is positioned at the end of the file
      - a+: open for reading and writing. The file is created if it does not exist. The stream is positioned at the end of the file
- Any created files will have mode 0666, as modified by the process' umask value

- FILE *fdopen(int fildes, const char *mode);

  - associates a stream with the existing file descriptor, fildes

- FILE *freopen(const char *path, const char *mode, FILE *stream);

  - opens the file whose name is the string pointed to by path and associates the stream pointed to by stream with it.
  - The original stream (if it exists) is closed.
  - The primary use of the freopen function is to change the file associated with a standard text stream(stderr, stdin, or stdout)

- return value
  - Upon successful completion fopen, fdopen and freopen return a FILE pointer. Otherwise, NULL is returned

### closing a stream

- synopsis

  - #include <stdio.h>
  - int fclose(FILE \*stream);

- description
  - dissociates the named stream from its underlying file or set of functions
  - if the stream was being used for output, any buffered data is written first, using fflush()

### reading and writing a stream

- type of I/O operation
  - character-at-a-time I/O (fgetc, fputc)
  - line-at-a-time I/O (fgets, fputs)
  - direct I/O (binary I/O, fread, fwrite)
  - formatted I/O (fprintf, fscanf)

### character-at-a-time I/O

- synopsis

  - #include <stdio.h>
  - int fgetc(FILE \*stream);
  - int getc(FILE \*stream);
  - int getchar(void);
  - int fputc(int c, FILE \*stream);
  - int putc(int c, FILE \*stream);
  - int putchar(int c);
  - int ungetc(int c, FILE \*stream);

- description
  - int fgetc(FILE \*stream);
    - reads the next character from stream and returns it as an unsigned char cast to an int
    - returns EOF on end of file or error
  - int getc(FILE \*stream);
    - equivalent to fgetc() except that it may be implemented as a macro
  - int getchar(void);
    - equivalent to getc(stdin)
  - int fputc(int c, FILE \*stream);
    - writes the character c, cast to an unsigned char, to stream
  - int putc(int c, FILE \*stream);
    - equivalent to fputc() except that it may be implemented as a macro
  - int putchar(int c);
    - equivalent to putc(c, stdout)
  - return value
    - fputc(), putc(), putchar() return the character written as an unsigned char cast to an int or EOF on error
  - int ungetc(int c, FILE \*stream);
    - pushes c back to stream, cast to unsigned char
    - it is available for subsequent read operation
    - only a single character can be pushed back
    - the character that we push back does not have to be the same character that was read
    - returns c on success, or EOF on error
  -     cf) int getw(FILE *stream);
  -     int putw(int c, FILE * stream);
    - the value returned on error is also a legitimate data value.

### ferror(), feof(), clearerr()

- synopsis

  - #include <stdio.h>
  - void clearerr(FILE \*stream);
  - int feof(FILE \*stream);
  - int ferror(FILE \*stream);

- description
  - clearerr()
    - clears the end-of-file and error indicators for the stream pointed to by stream
  - feof()
    - tests the end-of-file indicator for the stream
    - return nonzero if it is et
  - ferror()
    - tests the error indicator for the stream
    - returning non-zero if it is set

### line-at-a-time I/O

- synopsis

  - #include <stdio.h>
  - char *fgets(char *s, int size, FILE \*stream);
  - char *gets(char *s);
  - int fputs(const char *s, FILE *stream);
  - int puts(const char \*s);

- description

  - gets()
    - reads a line from stdin into the buffer pointed to by s until either a terminating newline or EOF, which it replaces with '\0'.
    - No check for buffer overrun is performed
  - fgets()
    - reads in at most one less than size characters from stream and stores them into the buffer pointer to by s
    - reading stops after an EOF or a newline. If a newline is read, it is stored into the buffer
    - '\0' is stored after the last character in the buffer

- fputs()

  - writes the string s to stream, without its trailing '\0'.

- puts()

  - writes the string s and a trailing newline to stdout.

- return value
  - gets(), fgets()
    - return s on success, and NULL on error or when end of file occurs while no characters have been read.
  - puts(), fputs()
    - return a non - negative number on success, or EOF on error.

### binary I/O

- synopsis

  - #include <stdio.h>
  - size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream);
  - size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t nmemb, FILE *stream);

- description

  - fread()
    - reads nmemb elements of data, each size bytes long, from the stream pointed to by stream, storing them at the location given by ptr
  - fwrite()
    - writes nmemb elements of data, each size bytes long, to the stream pointed to by stream, obtaining them from the location given by ptr

- return value

  - return the number of items successfully read or written, not the number of characters
  - If an error occurs, or the end-of-file is reached, the return value is a short item count (or zero).
  - fread does not distinguish between end-of-file and error, and callers must use feof() and ferror() to determine which occurred.

- example

```C
struct rec tmp;
struct rec item[10];

fread(&tmp, sizeof(struct rec), 1, fp);
fwrite(item, sizeof(struct rec), 10, fp);
```

### formatted I/O - output

- synopsis

  - #include <stdio.h>
  - int printf(const char \*format, ...);
  - int fprintf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...);
  - int sprintf(char *str, const char *format, ...);
  - int snprintf(char *str, size_t size, const char *format, ...);

- description
  - printf()
    - write output to stdout, the standard output stream
  - fprintf()
    - write output to the given output stream
  - sprintf(), snprintf()
    - write to the character string str
    - snprintf() does not write more than size bytes (including the trailing '\0')
  - return value
    - These functions return the number of characters printed (not including the trailing '\0' used to end output to strings)
    - negative value if output error
    - snprintf() returns -1 if the output was truncated due to size limit

### formatted I/O - input

- synopsis

  - #include <stdio.h>
  - int scanf(const char \*format, ...);
  - int fscanf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...);
  - int sscanf(const char *str, const char *format, ...);

- description

  - scanf()
    - reads input from the standard input stream stdin

- fscanf()

  - reads input from the stream pointer stream

- sscanf()

  - reads its input from the character string pointed to by str

- return value
  - return the number of input items aassigned
  - EOF if input error or end of file before any conversion

### positioning a stream

- synopsis

  - #include <stdio.h>
  - int fseek(FILE \*stream, long offset, int whence);
  - long ftell(FILE \*stream);
  - void rewind(FILD \*stream);
  - int fgetpos(FILE *stream, fpos_t *pos);
  - int fsetpos(FILE *stream, fpos_t *pos);

- description

  - fseek()
    - sets the file position indicator for the stream pointed to by stream
    - SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, SEEK_END
    - successful call to the fseek() clears the end-of-file indicator for the stream and undoes any effects of the ungetc()
    - return value
      - 0 if OK, -1 on error
  - ftell()
    - obtains the current value of the file position indicator for the stream
    - return value
      - current file position indicator if OK
      - -1L on error
  - rewind()
    - fseek(stream, 0, SEEK_SET); clearerr(stream);
  - fgetpos()
    - store the current value of the file offset into the object referenced by pos
  - fsetpos()
    - set the current value of the file offset into the object referenced by pos
  - return value
    - 0 if OK, -1 on error

- example

```C
fpos_t pos;
FILE *fp = fopen("bit", "r");
...
fgetpos(fp, &pos);
...
fsetpos(fp, &pos);
```

### fileno()

- synopsis

  - #include <stdio.h>
  - int fileno(FILE \*fp);

- description
  - examines the argument fp and returns the file descriptor associated with fp.

### Temporary Files

- synopsis

  - #include <stdio.h>
  - char *tmpnam(char *s);
  - FILE \*tmpfile(void);
  - char *tempnam(const char *dir, const char \*pfx);
  - #include <stdlib.h>
  - char *mktemp(char *template);
  - int mkstemp(char \*template);

- description
  - char *tmpnam(char *s);
    - generate a unique temporary filename using the path prefix P_tmpdir defined in <stdio.h>
    - If the argument s is NULL, tmpnam() returns the address of an internal static area which holds the filename, which is overwritten by subsequent calls to tmpnam()
    - If s is not NULL, the filename is returned in s
    - return value
      - a pointer to the unique temporary filename
      - NULL if a unique name cannot be generated
  - FILE \*tmpfile(void);
    - generates a unique temporary filename using the path prefix P_tmpdir defined in <stdio.h>
    - the temporary file is then opened in binary read/write (w+b) mode
    - the file will be automatically deleted when it is closed or the program terminates
    - return value
      - returns a stream descriptor
      - NULL if a unique filename cannot be generated or the unique file cannot be opened
- char *tempnam(const char *dir, const char \*pfx)

  - generates a unique temporary filename using up to five characters of pfx, if it is not NULL
  - The directory to place the file is searched for in the following order
    - The directory specified by the environment variable TMPDIR, if it is writable.
    - The directory specified by the argument dir, if it is not NULL.
    - The directory specified by P_tmpdir.
    - The directory /tmp.
  - The storage for the filename is allocated by malloc(), and so can be free'd by the function free().
  - return value
    - a pointer to the unique temporary filename
    - NULL if a unique filename cannot be generated.

- char *mktemp(char *template);

  - generates a unique temporary filename from template.
  - the last six characters of template must be "XXXXXX" and these are replaced with a string that makes the filename unique.
  - template must not be a constant string.
  - returns NULL on error, and template otherwise.

- int mkstemp(char \*template);
  - generates a unique temporary filename from template like mktemp().
  - the file is then created with mode read/write.
  - returns the file descriptor of the temporary file or -1 on error

### Variable Argument List

- synopsis

  - #include <stdarg.h>
  - va_list arglist;
  - void va_start(va_list ap, last);
  - type va_arg(va_list ap, type);
  - void va_end(va_list ap);

- description

  - va_start()
    - initializes ap for subsequent use by va_arg and va_end, and must be called first
    - The parameter last is the name of the last parameter before the variable argument list, i.e., the last parameter of which the calling function knows the type
  - va_arg()
    - an expression that has the type and value of the next argument in the call
    - Each call to va_arg modifies ap so that the next call returns the next argument
    - The first use of the va_arg macro after that of the va_start macro returns the argument after last
    - Successive invocations returns the values of the remaining arguments.

- va_end()

  - handles a normal return from the function whose variable argument list was initialized by va_start

- Example

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdarg.h>

int sum(int val, ...)
{
    va_lsit arglist;
    int arg, total;
    total = val;
    va_start(arglist, val);
    while ((arg = va_arg(arglist, int)) != 0)
      total += arg;

    va_end(arglist);
    return (total);
}

main()
{
    printf("Total sum: %d\n", sum(1,2,3,4,5,0));
}
```

### Example - copy

```C
#include <stdio.h>
#define MAXBUF 1024

main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    FILE *source, *dest;
    char buf[MAXBUF];
    int count;
    if (argc != 3) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s source destination \n", argv[0]);
        exit(1);
    }
    if ((source = fopen(argv[1], "r")) == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Can't open %s:", argv[1]);
        perror("");
        exit(1);
    }
    if ((dest = fopen(argv[2], "w")) == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Can't open %s:", argv[2]);
        perror("");
        exit(1);
    }
    while ((count = fread(buf, 1, MAXBUF, source))) {
        if (fwrite(buf, 1, count, dest) == 0) {
            perror("fwrite");
            exit(1);
        }
    }
    if (ferror(source)) {
        perror("fread");
        exit(1);
    }
    fclose(source);
    fclose(dest);
}
```
